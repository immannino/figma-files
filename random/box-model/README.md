I made this logo for fun one day, and turned it into a sweatshirt. I'm hosting it here so people can copy/customize/edit and make their own.

I used [Customized Girl](https://www.customizedgirl.com) to make mine. Simple download the image file, and go through their custom design portal to create your own!
